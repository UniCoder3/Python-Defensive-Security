## Chapter 1: Windows Event File Parser
Description: Learning how to parse information for data visualisation is a vital skill in Cyber Secuirty. In this chapter I created a windows event file parser that is able to scan a security log for event ID's and output the information in useful graphs and visualisation using matplotlib. I also added a progress bar to show speed of file parsing.
